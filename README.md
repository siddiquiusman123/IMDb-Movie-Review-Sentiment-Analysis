# 🎬 IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This project is a **Machine Learning & NLP–based web application** that predicts whether a movie review expresses a **Positive** or **Negative** sentiment.  
The application is deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to input reviews and receive **real-time predictions with confidence scores**.

---

## 📌 Features
- Advanced text preprocessing for clean and meaningful input
- TF-IDF vectorization with n-grams for better context understanding
- Machine Learning–based sentiment classification
- Interactive and user-friendly **Streamlit UI**
- Prediction confidence score for better interpretability
- Deployment-safe NLP pipeline (no tokenizer issues)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **NLTK** (Text preprocessing)
- **scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- **Streamlit** (Web Application)
- **Joblib** (Model persistence)

## 📊 Results & Performance
- Achieved strong accuracy using **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression**
- Performs well on negation-based reviews such as *“not good”* and *“not bad”*
- Tested on realistic IMDb-style movie reviews
- Successfully deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters a movie review
2. Text is cleaned and preprocessed
3. TF-IDF converts text into numerical features
4. ML model predicts sentiment
5. Result and confidence score are displayed

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Integrate **BERT / Transformer-based models**
- Add detailed evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Support for multi-language sentiment analysis
- Movie recommendation integration
